# âœ¨Hi! I'm Hailie
 > A recent mathematics graduate trying to develop their skills in programming! I studied Computational Mathematics using C++, git, and Python. Currently, I am working on developing my skills in Full-stack development. Currently I am employed, and doing this as a hobby to get back into programming.

I'm so fr, I don't know what i'm going to make as a project... Thanks though for checking this out if you did!

- Create 3d graphics
- run simple OOP games/projects
- learn how to program
- in groups within AI courses
