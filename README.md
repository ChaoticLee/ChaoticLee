# âœ¨Hi! I'm Hailie
 > A recent mathematics graduate trying to develop their skills in programming! I studied Computational Mathematics using C++, git, and Python. Currently, I am working on developing my skills in Full-stack development. Currently I am employed in the medical field (non-clinical), and doing this as a hobby to get back into programming. I am currently interested in Web Development and Game Development

- Comfortable with VIM, terminal, VSCode, and Pycharm
